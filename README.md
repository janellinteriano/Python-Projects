 <h1>Nice or Mean</h1>
 <p>This is a basic single player game where they will read through different scenerios and can choose whether to be nice or mean. Their choices will add up and their fate is decided at the end of the game. This program uses variables and multiple functions to create a fully functional game!</p>
 <br>
<h1>Phonebook</h1>
<p>This project is able to store users' names, phone numbers, and email adresses into a database. Here the user is able to edit and delete different entries of their choosing.</p>
<br>
<h1>GUI Files Project</h1>
<p>Users are able to transfer their .txt files to another directory of their choosing. The files are then stored into a database.</p>
<br>
<h1>Checkbook Project</h1>
<p>This project works as an application for keeping track of various bank accounts. Users can create their own account and add transactions. Their account balance is then updated and displayed for the user.</p>
